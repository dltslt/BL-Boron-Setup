# Customized Setup for BunsenLabs Boron

## Purpose

Early 2025 I set up *BunsenLabs Boron* on my **Thinkpad X1 Yoga Gen2**. I took
 many notes during my research and decided to reorganize and share them.

This repository covers some additional information about the packages used by
 *BunsenLabs Boron* and steps I took to achieve certain goals. Optimizations I
 made are device specific, while explanations about them should be general.

### My Device

I use *BunsenLabs Boron* on a **Thinkpad X1 Yoga Gen 2** in this configuration:

- Intel i5-7200U
- 8GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- BT, WLAN, WWAN
- FullHD Touch Screen
- dual boot setup with Windows 10 Pro (active bitlocker & secure boot)

### My Setup

 Currently I have a highly power efficient working setup for a coding
  environment, that is not perfect but okay. What is not mentioned in `setup.md`
  I didn't change from the default installation. Should I expand my feature set
  (eg. multi-touch-gestures for touchpad/-screen) I will add the steps.
